        "\n",
        "Ans 21. Feature scaling in machine learning is a technique that transforms numerical features in a dataset to a common scale or range, ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model's training and prediction. This process prevents features with larger values from dominating the learning process and helps improve the performance of algorithms sensitive to data scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how feature scaling helps in machine learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Equal Contribution of Features:\n",
        "Different features in a dataset might have vastly different ranges (e.g., age from 0 to 100, income from thousands to millions). Without scaling, features with larger ranges would disproportionately influence the model, leading to skewed results. Scaling ensures all features contribute equally, preventing any single feature from dominating the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Improved Algorithm Performance:\n",
        "Many machine learning algorithms, such as those based on distance calculations (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines) or gradient descent (e.g., neural networks), are sensitive to the scale of the data. Scaling can lead to faster convergence in gradient descent and better performance in algorithms relying on distance calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. More Accurate Model Interpretation:\n",
        "Scaled features make it easier to interpret the model's coefficients or feature importance scores. For example, in linear regression, comparing the coefficients of scaled features provides a more accurate understanding of their relative importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Handling Outliers:\n",
        "Some scaling techniques, like robust scaling, are designed to handle outliers more effectively. By scaling data based on percentiles, these methods are less sensitive to extreme values that might skew the results.\n",
        "\n",
